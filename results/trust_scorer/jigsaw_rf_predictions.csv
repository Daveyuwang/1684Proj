1.  Disagreeing with Trump when he says that water is wet would be wrong. I get confused, though, when Trump says that water is ice cream.  Is it OK to disagree with him then?  What about when he says that water is American?  How about when he says that water's wetness is the result of his years of honest, hard work, and that if liberals were in charge, water would be dry?

2.   In fairness, we should realize that the Democrats who disagree with him might have been arguing that ""water is wet"" is a poor answer to ""Why did you molest all those women by grabbing their pussies?""

3. ""Wet"" means ""has water on or within it"". It's what water does to other things. It's either like saying ""Trump is trumpy"", which is useless, and promotes unnecessary air movements, or it's like saying, ""this water on and in the other water is not the water that the water making it wet is"".

The alleged ""overthrow"" of the monarchy was not a people's revolution. it was a coup d'etat carried out by 32 white supremacist racist Americans with the illegal backing of the US military.

may I direct you to the scholarly research of Dr Ron Williams Jr., professor of Hawaiian History at UH Manoa ? Dr. Williams has gathered a considerable amount of unimpeachable evidence in his research of Hawaii's history surrounding the ""overthrow"". The evidence proves that the members of the Committee of Safety were blatant and unapologetic white supremacist racists who believed that, as a non-whites, Hawaiians were inferior subhumans that were incapable of governing themselves, despite having done so for thousands of years, and that they needed white men to govern over them.

It is the comprehensive and collision rates here that drive up the cost of insurance, not the liability.  Comprehensive coverage costs are driven by claims from road hazards, such as deer and potholes, and the costs of repairing/replacing damage due to hail.  Collision coverage costs are tied to the replacement value of your chosen vehicle. Today's cars are totaled by hail which would not have damaged a vehicle built in the 1950s or 1960s at all. The gauge of metal in your vehicle today is much less because lighter vehicles go further on a gallon of fuel. That thinner metal is also likely to result in more extensive damage in a collision, which results in a higher repair bill and a greater chance the vehicle will be a total loss after a collision.

Arguably, the divisions between people in question are overdone in too many cases and create an unnecessary barrier between those who leave and those who stay in Canada.  Focusing inordinately on these differences also serves to obscure the obvious advantage to all people in the US and Canada arising from the existence of two countries and therefore two choices of society that share the North American ethos and much else in common but exist with different political, social and institutional frameworks and scale.

My unambiguous choice is to live in Canada but I see no reason to assume that all Canadians share (or should share) my preference."

You understand wrong.

Some Tesla owners go through tires faster because they tend to accelerate faster than gasoline-aspirated engines.

Slow down and tires on a Tesla will last just as long as on any other car.

The weight of the battery pack is not a factor at all.

Wildlife Conservation Society? $230M. World Wildlife Fund? $204M. The Conservation Fund? $138M. Natural Resources Defense Council? $123M. National Audubon Society? $89M. And by the way, most NWF funding seems to be from non-hunters.

Compare those laudatory amounts with annual funding by federal agencies like FWS, NPS, USFS, and BLM which totaled $18,671 million, with an estimated 95% from non-hunters. Even most of the Pittman-Robertson funding comes from non hunters.

There are two sides to the ""go to a church that suits you"" argument. One is that finding another church to attend is seeking your own ways and pursuing sin. The other, which was my experience, was finding spiritual survival and recovery because I was being driven-away from God by the tradition-based form of godliness where the power of God could not be found. I am certain that I would not be an Adventist today if I had stayed there and I likely would have abandoned all faith in God. More than that, I would not have found active, fulfilling ministry in the power of the Holy Spirit and I would not be bringing people into the church. No, it is not ""big tent"" religion that embraces everything sinful, but one where the power of God to redeem ""unto the uttermost"" is ministered to bring sinners to salvation.

I think you have a very valid point.  When the results of the San Antonio vote were announced, there was a collective gasp in the crowd of onlookers.  Anyone who understands how to count noses, realized that a fair number of ""third world"" delegates, must have voted YES.

In addition to being a ""urban"" vs ""rural"" split as you suggest, I think there was and is also a strong generational split on this question, around the world.  Even in Africa we are seeing a few women appear as heads of state.  Younger people are growing-up with the idea that women can and and do have leadership gifts and roles apart from the home, and caring for the elderly and the children.

But in some cultures the younger SDA leaders are unwilling to openly oppose their elders.  They will simply wait for them to retire and/or die.  And I think some of these elders sense this, which is why they have become so urgent to stop-out the new ideas now.

BBD will not ship to Delta until tariffs are dropped (unless Delta is willing to pay them) which means shuffling its delivery schedule and finding other buyers. I understand the latter is in the works.

Canada will launch NAFTA and WTO challenges. The US will prolong a WTO process for years. The US will not agree to dispute resolution under NAFTA arguing technicalities.

The tariffs may be part of a NAFTA deal bit I doubt it. Canada will resist its use as a bargaining chip. The US is unlikely to drop it without concessions.

The US will eventually reduce but not eliminate the duties. BBD will not ship to the US, ever, since it can sell to the world instead.

If he had killed Northern Gateway in a standalone announcement, many Albertans would have been furious, and the media would have reflected that anger.  But the death of Northern Gateway has resulted in no negative reactions. Meanwhile, the PM knew that the U.S.-funded, west-coast environmental and indigenous groups would take their objections to Trans Mountains to the Courts, using the ""lack of consultation with indigenous groups"" as their main argument. Construction will not start until the Court process is completed, and that will take years. And in the end, the activist Courts, with their strong sympathies for aboriginals, will  likely declare invalid the process that led to the approval of the pipeline. The result? Trans Mountain will not be built during the PM's first term, if ever, and the PM can go into the next election with no new pipeline having been built to the west coast."

Just let the OIA do as in the past, and play their regular schedule. Then have the top 4 teams playoff for the 2 Open division spots, as well as OIA champions. Like York said, Open or bust.

Stay strong, stay brave and just know. There really is nothing anyone could have done. If people are going to drink to the point of incapacitation they will do it or find a way to do it.

Sadly the only way to prevent or possibly stopped such a tragedy from happening was if she had been with a friend. No matter who you are -- if you are alone and drinking alone, it is possible that you are putting your life in danger.

If it is any condolences to you --- it does not sound like suicide to me. But more or less caught star gazing and any rational thought was gone. Intoxication can cause one to do strange things as we all know.

Godbless you and family and your lovely daughter."

It sounds as if they have found ways to serve in the Church with out being a priest, why not concentrate on that service instead of dreaming and wanting something that will never happen. Like children that always want the toy a brother has, simply because it's a boy and the old green-eyed monster raises its head. They want the priesthood because the Church says no.

Your argument about BSA is a poor choice. Like you mention, the BSA is a private company. The DNC is the formal governing body for a nationally recognized political party. In my opinion, you are comparing apples to oranges here.

Alaskans on Premera Blue Cross' individual insurance market plans will see their monthly premium grow by nearly 10 percent in 2017, a significantly smaller increase than those seen in the past two years, thanks to a $55 million cash injection from the state.
The reinsurance program will be funded by the state's insurance premium tax, a roughly 2.7 percent tax levied on every insurance policy in the state, including renters, life, automotive and health insurance, Wing-Heier said. House Bill 374 passed the Legislature on June 4 and Gov. Bill Walker signed the bill Monday afternoon, according to Wing-Heier.

That is not correct in terms of what people  are doing in the more complex scientific problems where  numbers systems do fail.

Well the more we study such complex issues we see that the proofs we use are indeed abstract using abstract numbers systems that often are not sufficient.

Of course I'm concerned about the ""quality of clergy,"" as are we all.

Is that what you mean to say?

Now, overstretching personnel certainly affects quality, which is where my analysis bears some consideration. By my calculation, admitting married men to the priesthood would *reduce* total clergy availability, thereby overstretching them further. If I'm right, what does *that* do to quality?"

How we came to profess herterdoxy every Sunday is a very interesting tale. If you care, let me know and I'll explain it to you. It really is a complex story of the meaning of words."

I recognize change is tough, and perhaps tougher for those over 75 to contemplate than for younger people.  However, if a retired couple or single is sitting in an older home in Vancouver valued at over a million or so, it's time to sell and move out.  Not out of the city necessarily (although, beyond 75, most oldsters probably aren't really able to enjoy its benefits as they once did), nor, sometimes, even out of their neighbourhoods.  Buy a condo with the windfall bucks.  Rent a one- or two-bedroom in a seniors' home.

In effect, it internalised the cost of waste disposal into the cost of the product, theoretically meaning that the producers will improve the waste profile of their products, thus decreasing waste and increasing possibilities for reuse and recycling.

In cases of sexual assault involving young people, usually involving alcohol, usually occurring in private, involving questions of consent, the cases are especially difficult to decide fairly. 

The other system of essentially criminal justice is housed in our universities. This has been forced on the universities by the Civil Rights Office of the Department of Education and its broad interpretation of Title IX. It is a makeshift system that must--whenever a mention of sexual assault is even overheard--conduct an investigation, reach a decision, and enforce sanctions.

Historically, however, you are decidedly out to lunch.  

Usually, there is a strong correlation between the approval rating % for the party leader and the vote % the party winds up receiving.

With 3 relatively strong major parties in Ontario, it is possible for one to win a majority with 36-39% of the vote.

But no party can win a majority or even a minority if they stand at 16% in the polls and no party whose leader at election time stands at 16% in the polls will pull more than 24-25% of the vote (usually within 5 points of 16%).

If you have a persuasive argument otherwise, I would be fascinated to hear it.

And in the second place, it's not lack of confidence that keeps us from bringing this up to the Pope -- people have been talking and urging the ordination of women and married men for at least 40 years (because I remember it being discussed when I was in college).

Liberal people are open hearted and try to help the homeless. Saw it in Cali, see it even more here. The homeless, many of whom are alcoholic/drug addicted transients rather than homeless by reason of a temporary bad break, take advantage of this kindness, they can smell it. The liberal people I know feed, clothe, and even foot bathe the homeless, they see them as people and want to help. Unfortunately, it means downtown businesses and people who would otherwise enjoy the downtown areas that are infested with loud, mentally ill, drugged out and obnoxious transients, cannot walk down the street without getting abused. I have compassion for folks who are homeless by a bad break, the ones who are doing whatever they can to build better lives. The others, not so much.

The priest was not living the situation - by-the-book answers do not deal with real life.  (That happened to my mother and grandmother over issues of sterilization.

Minimum wage is a tool to control inflation. Minimum wage jobs are not meant to be a career choice.

By increasing minimum wage, you temporarily increase the buying power of minimum wage recipients. As those people enter the market looking to spend their windfall, demand obviously increases. Suffice it to say, so does the price of those items in demand. Now, those people end up right back to where they were before, unable to afford what they want.

""Hebrew women were not allowed to divorce their husbands, but could be divorced for anything from burning the dinner (Hillel) to adultery (Shammai). In a culture in which women did not survive unless they were linked to the patriarchal household, it was disastrous to be divorced. Seen in this light, Jesus' proscription of divorce is markedly protective of women. The raising of the son of the widow of Nain is another example of Jesus' compassion for the poverty of a woman whose survival was threatened by the loss of her link to the patriarchal household. Most Hebrew women had minimal property rights. Theoretically women could inherit land, but in practice male heirs had precedence.

The problem with what you posit is that 82 beds left represents 13%  margin from being at capacity. This means the hospital is in a position where they have to carefully pick and choose only the worst cases and turn away others if funded.  In this sense Salem is not prepared, and therefore they are at capacity. What makes you think that 82 beds used up today will be enough for the 100 more that might be needed tomorrow ? Furthermore, those beds are 66 miles away and are primarily for Multnomah County residents. I am sorry for the cheap shots at CAHOOTS, but EPD has no other option available to them now, so of course they will only say great things. Eugene just launched a mental health court in an effort to step up and identify those people that need more than outpatient care. How can this court be effective without a local institution?

If the goal is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions the solution is a SIMPLE, transparent and equal tax on greenhouse gas emissions, one that REPLACES (rather than supplements) the numerous existing taxes on fossil fuels.

If government is doing anything more complex than that they are doing so for reasons other than to reduce greenhouse gases."

If the USA wasn’t willing to cross the frontier of China during the Korean War, when it was hugely more powerful than China, it would take a true paranoid to see it wishing to do so in future.  If China is really worried about an attack, North Korea is the bigger threat.

Wade had exceeded its Constitutional authority, that the decision's due process theorizing was a botch of Constitutional law, and that the issue should have been left to the political process rather than decided by a panel of un-elected judges, ""the least democratic branch.""  Even Justice Ginsburg has said the same.  

So:  ""Dissassociate"" abortion from politics?  What kind of democrat (small ""d"") would do that?"

Oil and filter changes well within recommended intervals are cheap engine insurance. Also buy oil filters from a reputable source such as FRAM - not the OEM versions which I have found to be largely ineffective.
I do my own to ensure proper high quality oil and efficient filters - saves tiome and money. Engines should last > 250,000Km these days without burning oil or loosing pressure.

There were collaborationists among many of the nations invaded by Nazi Germany.

In the case of Ukraine, one must remember that Ukrainians' memories, in 1939, of the rule from Moscow included the Soviet genocide against Ukrainians in 1932-33 in which millions of Ukrainians were intentionally starved to death.

Based on that experience, the Germans probably looked less dangerous than the Soviets.

I look at the number and size of campaign signs and, to me, this is straightforward representation of how much corporate money has flowed to the BC Liberals, to distort their policies in favour of corporate gains over societal gains, and I can see the exact degree to which the ruling party is serving the populace of BC versus corporate interest.

I agree with the thrust of your comment.

In fact, I see the overreaction of the broad middle of NDP activists (which played into the hands of the more militant factions that never approved of the Layton/Mulcair approach that too many of them, too often rejected without a care that their own nostrums would doom the NDP to fringe irrelevance on the Federal political scene) as a clear example an irrational tendency to which we all are prone.

The broader NDP membership supported the Layton/Mulcair approach but many of them became disheartened by the last minute failure in the 2015 election to improve on the 2011 breakthrough. Their overreaction is well described by the behavioral physiology findings of Kahnerman & Tversky that everyone is prone to judge past experiences by their final outcome (even to judge long term good experiences that ended with disappointment as bad)."

This refers to Peter Waldo, a black boy who had lived with Lane from about the time he was two, having been placed there by the court when he was an orphan in 1864.
You'll find a great piece of historical research at http://id.mind.net/~truwe/tina/waldo.html
An interesting newspaper item from Nov. 1878 reported on Waldo, now about 16/17, being sent to the pen for theft:
 ""Peter Waldo is a native of Douglas County, and is a descendant, on the mother's side, of African parents. He was raised and cared for by Gen. Jos. Lane until the old gentleman could control him no longer, since which time he has been on the ""ragged edge"" almost continually.""
Shortly before Lane died in 1881  he sent a note to his old friend James Nesmith which  requested  Nesmith ""see that he [Waldo] gets work of some honorable character"" when released from the pen."

However, that doctrine doesn't grant carte blanche authority.  Furthermore, the plenary power doctrine has its roots not in the constitution, but in racist immigration laws of the 1800's.  That's why courts have limited the effect of the doctrine.  
Instead, the travel should be evaluated based on its ability to reduce terrorism in the U.S., as Trump says it will.  However, the addition of North Korea to the travel ban shows that the purpose of the travel ban is not to reduce terrorism.  North Korea is a closed country, and almost no North Koreans visit the U.S.  Those few are largely diplomats going to the U.N., and they are allowed under the travel ban.  There have been no terrorist incidents in the U.S. caused by North Korean immigrants.

The Afghan bombing was as much or more a warning to North Korea as an attempt to shore-up American domestic allies in Afganistan (and slow ISIL attempts to displace the Taliban as the Sunni fundamentalist opposition to those domestic allies).

In the absence of clear longer term objectives and commitments, however, the afghan bombing, like the Syrian naval bombardment, will have little or no enduring positive impact. Rather, these 2 one-offs may only serve to ratchet up the chaos in Syria/Iraq and Afganistan.

As for North Korea, the key is to get China and Russia to lean heavily on the North Koreans.  It's anyone's guess how China and Russia are reacting to all this US activity without commitment or long term planning."

Also . . . ""the aesthetics"" . . . You mean: clean drinking water, breathable air, healthy fish, game habitat and hunting grounds, and the main publicly owned forest recreation area for the whole region? It has nothing to do with aesthetics, no one cares what it looks like.

By contrast, Helfrich and Kelly seemed more ""traditional"", but over time, especially in the last few seasons, that approach wasn't working as well anymore.

As for recruiting QBs specifically, I think Taggart has a good track record. When he was the running backs coach under Jim Harbaugh at Stanford, he helped to recruit Andrew Luck, who was a pro-style QB. At his last stop, University of South Florida, Taggart recruited and developed Quinton Flowers into a dual-threat QB running a prolific offense. The most obvious need for Ducks recruiting is defense.

If you look at the current P/E of the market, it is heavily skewed by energy companies (the S&P500 energy sub index has a P/E of 139X) because their earnings are significantly depressed.  You could argue that they are pretty much the biggest reason why this market looks expensive (you also have expensive utilities and consumer staples and other ""safe havens"").  

Yes, at these oil prices, earnings from energy companies are set to expand meaningfully.  But not anywhere close to where they were in 2014 so keep that enthusiasm in check.  But still there is an argument for earnings from this sector to go from pretty much 0 to much higher than 0.  That brings down the market P/E.

Some were conquering, some built massive structures and large infrastructure works , others were nomadic. Many affected their environment and controlled it, changing local climates, deforestation, etc others did not. Most adapted to new technologies, whether horses or guns, etc, and modified their societies accordingly. Sadly, what they couldn't fight was germs and diseas, which wiped 90% of them out.

Renewable energy is microchip based and subject to a form of moores law - costs per kwh reduce by around 14% every year.

Coal, nuclear and diesel generated electricity cost rise constantly over time.

Utility level battery and other forms of storage of renewables is already a reality - in some new applications in California and South Australia, the cost of renewable generation WITHOUT SUBSIDIES is below the cost of transmision - in other words, even if the ESKOMS of that part of the world generated the electricity for free, it would be cheaper to use renewables owing to the cost of transmission.

Many of his current critics may relish what an easy target Trump provides for their 24/7 news cycle day, but one only has to look at past President Theodore Roosevelt to  see the similarities in their treatment when he became our country's leader.  The same level of criticism was leveled later at his cousin, Franklin D. Roosevelt, when he was first elected during the middle of the Great Depression.  Both Roosevelts came from wealth and were thought to be unable to assist the working class of the United States.  Well, they proved all their critics wrong.

As the Washington Post reported, Bannon has other ideas:

Bannon, in phone calls and meetings, has been urging Trump for months to not mount a fall campaign that makes Republican donors and officials comfortable, the aides said. Instead, Bannon has been telling Trump to run more fully as an outsider and an unabashed nationalist."

Renting isn't all negatives. My wife and I have been fortunate enough, either before we met, or after, to have responsible landlords. If something broke, they fixed it. They were responsible for general maintenance, groundskeeping, snow shoveling, etc. In return, we gave them rent payments and they kept the property when we moved.
Short of having the cash on hand, buying a home means a decades-long financial commitment. Renting is generally year-to-year. In the case of our move to Englewood, we gave proper notice to our previous landlord, signed a new contract with our new landlord, arranged for movers, and we moved.

To the degree that there is to be a new look at racism in the US, I would suggest it needs to be in the form of a dialog: an honest listening by BOTH sides.  To be clear, of COURSE I believe that injustices should be fought, resisted and overturned wherever possible.  The question may well become HOW to do that.

I think it important to DRAW people into that dialog.  And whether fair or not, right or not, violence, riots, destruction of property (etc.) will do little to draw people into that dialog.  In today's politically correct media environment, there are legitimate issues that simply cannot be brought up, and I think that too restricts dialog.  In your post, you did something I see often, when you stated ""Yes, the violence is deplorable. But...""  To many, that comes off as an often used ""end justifies the means"" argument.

The problem with cutting retirements and benefits and not keeping pace with inflation for wages however is it is getting harder and harder to hire people and even harder to retain the ones we have. Especially in the lower paying towns. If you are having to hire cops to replace the ones that leave every 2 years you are paying 36% more per cop because it takes up to 8 months to train the officers and get them on their own. That 8 months is the combined total of the academy and Field training.  It is actually cheaper to pay people a bit more to retain them or offer better benefits than it is to treat them like they are disposable. As for inflation I have been doing this for 17 years. I entered my wages into an inflation calculator and 17 years later I am only making $3 an hour more in real money from when I started. Health care costs have gone through the roof in the same time.

The temperature of fires (part of a natural cycle) is of critical importance and the introduction of alien species completely upsets the natural fire cycle, which has been in place for centuries  at least. To say that a fynbos fire would be no less damaging is no more than a guess - what is your evidence for that statement? The loss of the fynbos from this fire is devastating, and the steady erosion of a major natural ecosystem has been hugely accelerated. While I acknowledge your observations about how  communities responded, I am dismayed by your single-minded devotion to an completely outmoded school of thought."

In a pluralistic society, governed by the principle of separation of church and state, the answer to that question is meaningless, useless, irrelevant.  The ""Law of God"" means different things to believers of different stripes, and nothing to non-believers. Civil law emerges from a process that allows everyone, believers and non-believers alike, to advocate their beliefs; but none of those beliefs is privileged in the legislative process, in the law, or in the enforcement of the law. When the requirements of the law genuinely conflict with the conscience of a citizen, that citizen enjoys the prerogative of engaging in civil disobedience -- but must expect to suffer the consequences of breaking the law.
